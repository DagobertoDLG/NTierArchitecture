üöÄ Welcome to the **NTierArchitecture** repository! üöÄ

This repository focuses on implementing a robust **DotNet N-Tier Architecture**. Here, we delve into various aspects such as **clean code**, **cross-cutting concerns**, **dependency injection**, and many more. Our goal is to provide a structured and efficient architecture for your DotNet projects.

## Overview

In the world of software development, having a well-defined architecture is crucial for the success of any project. This repository explores the concept of **N-Tier Architecture** in the context of DotNet development. By leveraging best practices such as **SOLID principles**, **repository pattern**, and **unit of work**, we aim to streamline the development process and enhance the maintainability of your codebase.
